# Uninest SEO, GEO & LLMO Master Strategy Report

## Executive Summary
The Uninest visibility strategy is built on three pillars to capture both traditional search and modern AI-driven queries:
1. **Traditional SEO**: Ranking on Google/Bing for keyword searches.
2. **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**: Structuring facts for citation in Perplexity, Bing Copilot, and Google AI Overviews.
3. **LLMO (Large Language Model Optimization)**: Controlling the "Entity Definition" so ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini understand and recommend Uninest accurately.

## 1. Canonical Entity Definition
A core element of the strategy is distributing a precise, canonical description of what Uninest is across all platforms (Website, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, etc.). 
* **Definition**: Uninest is an AI-powered student ecosystem platform based in India that serves university students through two hubs: The Marketplace (hostels, libraries, food mess, products) and The Workspace (internships, competitions, AI co-pilot).
* **Key AI Guarantee**: The AI uses human-in-the-loop (HITL) and *never* makes bookings or submits applications without explicit approval.

## 2. Keyword Strategy
Keywords are divided into four targeted clusters:
* **Cluster A (Student Marketplace)**: e.g., "hostel near [college]", "live library seat booking"
* **Cluster B (Student Workspace)**: e.g., "AI internship application helper", "internship platform India free"
* **Cluster C (Vendor)**: e.g., "list my hostel for students India", "free student vendor listing"
* **Cluster D (Brand & LLMO)**: Questions students ask AI (e.g., "What is Uninest?", "Is there an AI to help write internship applications?")

## 3. GEO Content Pillars & Rules
To ensure AI engines cite Uninest, content must be structured specifically for AI consumption:
* **8 Core Pillars**: Includes pages like "What is Uninest?", "Live Library Seat Booking", and Vendor Registration guides.
* **GEO Rules**: 
  - Define the topic in the first sentence.
  - Use exact facts and numbers (e.g., "Llama-3.3-70b-versatile via Groq").
  - Use consistent entity naming ("Uninest").
  - Structure heavily in FAQ format.

## 4. Master FAQ Bank
FAQs are the highest-value content for LLMs. The strategy provides a comprehensive bank of FAQs for Students (Marketplace & Workspace) and Vendors that must be published with proper Schema Markup.

## 5. Technical SEO & Schema
Technical health ensures crawlability and parsing by AI:
* **Schema Markup**: `Organization`, `SoftwareApplication`, and `FAQPage` JSON-LD schemas must be implemented.
* **Basic SEO**: Fast load times (LCP < 2.5s), HTTPS, Mobile-first design, Canonical tags, Open Graph tags.

## 6. Off-Page SEO & Citations
LLMs learn from what authoritative sites say. Priority is building citations on:
1. Google Business Profile
2. Crunchbase & Product Hunt
3. Indian Startup Press (YourStory, Inc42)
4. LinkedIn, Wikipedia (if eligible), and College Blogs

## 7. Action Plan & 90-Day Calendar
A prioritized 90-day publishing and technical implementation schedule is provided.
The Top 3 immediate actions are:
