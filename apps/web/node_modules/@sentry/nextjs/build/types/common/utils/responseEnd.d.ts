/**
 * Wrap `res.end()` so that it ends the span and flushes events before letting the request finish.
 *
 * Note: This wraps a sync method with an async method. While in general that's not a great idea in terms of keeping
 * things in the right order, in this case it's safe, because the native `.end()` actually *is* (effectively) async, and
 * its run actually *is* (literally) awaited, just manually so (which reflects the fact that the core of the
 * request/response code in Node by far predates the introduction of `async`/`await`). When `.end()` is done, it emits
 * the `prefinish` event, and only once that fires does request processing continue. See
 * https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/7c9b607048f13741173d397795bac37707405ba7.
 *
 * Also note: `res.end()` isn't called until *after* all response data and headers have been sent, so blocking inside of
 * `end` doesn't delay data getting to the end user. See
 * https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#responseenddata-encoding-callback.
 *
 * @param span The span tracking the request
 * @param res: The request's corresponding response
